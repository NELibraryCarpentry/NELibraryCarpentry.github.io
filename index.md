# New England Library Carpentry

## Our Mission
We're a group of New England library workers helping build confidence in tech tools and literacy for public librarians using lessons from the Carpentries organization.

## What is The Carpentries organization? 

Library Carpentry workshops teach people working in library and information-related roles how to:
* Cut through the jargon terms and phrases of software development and data science and apply concepts from these fields in library tasks
* Identify and use best practices in data structures
* Learn how to programmatically transform and map data from one form to another
* Work effectively with researchers, IT, and systems colleagues
* Automate repetitive, error prone tasks

We are the New England branch of the Library Carpentries: https://librarycarpentry.org

Our parent organization is The Carpentries: https://carpentries.org
